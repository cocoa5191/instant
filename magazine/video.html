        ## Tinder and the commodification of human relationships

      </h1>

    
      <div class="content">

        <p>

          Tinder is a social media platform that allows users to swipe through profiles of others and match in order to exchange messages. One of the biggest reasons why many people use Tinder is because they experience visual pleasure (reward). However, isn't this pleasure connected to capitalist commodification?
          
          <br><br>Tinder has established itself as a successful social media platform due to its easy and convenient interface and high number of users. Users can form a variety of human relationships and meet new people. However, this convenience and efficiency creates new problems for human relationships.

        <div class="h2">### Cultural capitalism and human relationships</div>
          
          <div class="anker"  data-target="tinder"></div>

          <p> Cultural capitalism is a socio-economic system that commodifies spiritual values rather than physical values and sells them. This leads to a kind of market competition, and the commodified values are used in a competitive market. The visual pleasure on Tinder can also be seen as an example of cultural capitalism. When users swipe through profiles and match, they can exchange messages if they both express mutual interest. Users become more addictive to the context of cultural capitalism as they receive rewards when matched.
          
          <br><br>However, cultural capitalism is also related to human relationships. A match on Tinder goes beyond a simple human relationship and becomes a commodified relationship. Treating another person as a commodity leads to the loss of human relationships. This commodification of cultural capitalism distorts the essence of human relationships and distorts the perspective of users on human relationships.

        <div class="h2">### Dopamine addiction and lack of humanity</div>
        <div class="anker"  data-target="dopamine"> </div>
         <p> The reward on Tinder is related to cultural capitalism. The jackpot effect when matched is one of the reasons for users' addiction. This is a type of reinforcement learning, and the human brain expects rewards even in uncertainty and irregularity. One of these rewards is a match on Tinder.
          
          <br><br>This addiction is also related to dopamine addiction. Dopamine is one of the substances that provide pleasure in our brain. Users become more addictive as dopamine is secreted while they continue to swipe. However, this addiction leads to a lack of humanity in the commodified human relationship on Tinder. Most human relationships on Tinder begin with just seeing someone's face and liking it. This distorts the essence of human relationships and the perspective of users on human relationships.
          <br>
        </p>
        
        <div class="h2"> ### Solutions to problems</div>
          
         <p>
         Tinder has caused addiction and problems of cultural capitalism due to the commodification of human relationships. The loss of human relationships and lack of humanity cannot be replaced by short-term pleasure or happiness. We need to recognize these problems and pursue healthier and more sustainable human relationships outside of the reward-centered culture. This will help us maintain our values as humans and achieve healthier and more sustainable human relationships.
          
          <br><br>Since users on Tinder are matched only by liking each other, they are more likely to match too easily without understanding or interest in each other's human relationships. Therefore, Tinder needs to provide users with more information and help them understand each other better.
          
          <br><br>In addition, education is needed to remind users of the essence of human relationships while using Tinder. This education should be provided by independent third parties, not by Tinder itself. This education will help users have a correct understanding of human relationships and form healthier and more sustainable human relationships.
          <br>
        </p> 
        
        <div class="h2">### Conclusion</div>
          
      <p> Tinder has established itself as a successful social media platform due to its easy and convenient interface and high number of users. However, such social media platforms are creating new problems for human relationships. We need to recognize these problems and use social media platforms like Tinder to form healthier and more sustainable human relationships. This will help us maintain our values as humans and achieve healthier and more sustainable human relationships.</p>
